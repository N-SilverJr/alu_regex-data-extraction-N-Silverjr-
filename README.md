# Regex Data Extraction
In this Project I generated some random data then I used Regex to extract it differently. I ended up creating two files for that namely:<br>
1. [Regex-work.py](https://github.com/N-SilverJr/alu_regex-data-extraction-N-Silverjr-/blob/main/Regex-work.py)
2. [Test.py](https://github.com/N-SilverJr/alu_regex-data-extraction-N-Silverjr-/blob/main/Test.py)<br>
In Regex-work.py, I put all my work/code that extracted data from Test.py making my code easily accessible.
